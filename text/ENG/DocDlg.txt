Tavern/JoinBrotherhood
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ......Did I hear you right? Our guest wants to join the fraternity?
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Hmm... Should I still take you?
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] But since you're so eager to get to the brotherhood, let's do my quest.
\CamCT\narr \c[3]The innkeeper\c[0] began looking around the room quickly.
\narr After making sure no one was listening to them, he returned his gaze to \c[6]Lona\c[0].
\narr You may notice that earlier his face looked relaxed. However, in any case, he resembles a redneck from the collective farm.
\narr That is, his expression became more sullen and serious.
\CamMP[Doc]\narrOFF\c[3]Doknightovich：\c[0] Got it, \c[6]Tachmi\c[0]. I need to use some \c[18]nuclear batteries\c[0] for my tavern.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Total - I need \c[4]5\c[18]nuclear batteries\c[0] and \c[6]10 gold coins\c[0].
\c[3]Doknightovich：\c[0] And if it's expensive, then-oh... Ahem.. I can drop the price to \c[6]5 coins\c[0].
\c[3]Doknightovich：\c[0] What do you decide?

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodNoSex
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] So... At the moment you owe \c[6]10 gold coins\c[0].

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodYesSex
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Good... Protected.. Ahem.. Service, price - \c[6]5 gold coins\c[0].

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodNoGold
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] But you don't have enough money.

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodNahui
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Come back when you have more experience!

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodNoBattery
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] But you don't have enough \c[18]batteries\[0]... I can't erase Noer like that... OH I mean, MAKE A GOOD stew.

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodYesBattery
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] And \c[18]batteries\c[0] with me... Actually, I was joking about them... But that's okay

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodAccept
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Well... You passed my \c[3]test\c[0]. Few succeed... Probably...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] In general, you can count on our help in difficult times.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] But the final \c[18]decision\c[0] is up to you. So do you agree?
\CamCT\c[6]Lona：\c[0] ...
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Actually, you don't really decide anything here. The author of the mod is just too lazy to prescribe dialogues.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Welcome to our \c[5]family\c[0]! From now on, your name means nothing here, as we welcome anonymity.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] From now on, your pursuit...I mean.. Now you're the nickname is \c[6]"Tachmi"\c[0]. It suits you very well.
\narr NOTE：\c[6]Tachmi\c[0] - is 'touch me'.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] And yes, we have a division into ranks here. So far, you are nothing more than a \c[3]friend\c[0].
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Also, now you get a room at my disposal, you can live here.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Later we will bring \c[18]chest\c[0] there for convenience. Use for health.

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodPreSex
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Ahem.. Here it is.. Ahem.. A specific case...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] You see, the old waitress feeds the worms, and there is no one else... Ahem...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Basically. I recive: \c[5]your butthole\c[0]. You recive: \c[18]5 gold discount\c[0].
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] That'll be enough... Ahem... Ahem-ahem... Ahh... A fair decision, so to speak...

Tavern/JoinBrotherhoodPreSex
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] \{Yo-Hoo!!!\}

Dlg/AboutGuestsExit
No one

Tavern/Barter
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] A glass in the morning is wonderful!

Tavern/Exit
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Well, you are... come back here, anything..

Tavern/AboutTavern
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Oh.. This is our diner. What, didn't you see our leaflets in the city? That's what you need...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] This place was built by myself when I wandered around the map in search of food and content.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Well, this village attracted my attention. Quiet, without raids and random meetings.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] It's like a local oasis - a safe and peaceful place... Well, that's fine.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Then I liked one of the buildings：I took it and rebuilt it.
\narr \c[3]The innkeeper\c[0] nodded towards the room you were in.
\narr Rotten boards can be seen in places. Most likely from time to time.
\narrOFF\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] And we formed a \c[29]tavern\c[0]. We help each other in difficult times...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] If it's necessary...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ...
\CamCT\narrOFF\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Anything else?

Tavern/AboutGuestsNoBeer
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] I can talk day and night, but first order something from me.

Tavern/AboutGuests
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Hmm, what... More precisely, who should I talk about? There are few people here.

Tavern/AboutVolodimer
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] As I said, there are few people here, and mostly employees of the establishment.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] However, we accept anyone：from a robber and a troll in the chat, to a knight and a former administrator...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Like \c[5]Volodimer\c[0]. He was the administrator of one "\c[6]place\c[0]".
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] People didn't seem to like his announcements, so the top brass kicked him out and he went here.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Right now it's going through all my \c[18]fines\c[0] and taxes...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] What difference does it make what the penalty is? Anyway, no one will get here from Noer.

Tavern/AboutTaffer
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Ah, \c[9]Tuffer\c[0], he's generally in charge of the kitchen at the moment.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] He doesn't know a damn thing about cooking, but that's not critical. I just gave him one book...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] "\c[18]How to Cook a Communist in 5 Minutes\c[0]". He also handed him a couple of papers that he managed to steal in Noer.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] We now have a large supply of protein. There, \c[11]Green Ass\c[0] guys are running behind the tavern.

Tavern/AboutShiza
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] \c[2]Shiz\c[0] used to be my boss at my last job, but times are changing.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Many keep up with the times... Like \c[2]Shiz\c[0].. Bipolar..
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] From the outside it looks like an adequate, young, well-groomed man. In fact, as he told me...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] \c[18]\{Panzerkampfwagen Neubaufahrzeug drei. Jahr\}
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] I don't know what that means... Oh well. In general, a very strange man, but most importantly, he is faithful to me and his code.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] I've never heard of.

Tavern/AboutDick
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] hahahahahahahahaha
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ahahahhahahahahaha... No, well, like \c[18]DICK\c[0]... Like \c[18]DICK\c[0].. Got it, yes ?
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Yeah... I've heard about that funny slurry. They say he works as a bouncer for me.
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Well, if he works part-time, then I pay him \c[4]10 times less\c[0].

Tavern/FirstMeeting
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Welco-ome to o-our tavern!
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Fresh flies! Dead whores! Used treasure maps and annoying beggar-e-e .. ahem ..
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Oh, you already know? Well then order...
\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] ...

Tavern/Menu1
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] What shall we order?

Tavern/Menu2
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Decided to stop by?

Tavern/Menu3
\CamMP[Doc]\c[3]DocNightovich：\c[0] Fifteen people for a drunkard's chest... Yo-ho-ho! And a bottle of rotten wine...
